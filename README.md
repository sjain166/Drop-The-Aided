# Drop-The-Aided
MATLAB application using EV3 Module for Self Driven Car

1. We are working on MATLAB and EV3 Module. 
2. The Simulation Software is RoboSim, so the machine should have JAVA SDK installed.
3. Our model works in two modes: Automatic and Manual.
4. The Pick-Up Task is the only task achieved manually. 
5. Move the model to the coordinates (24.00, 16.00) at an angle of 90 degrees manually, and then press The “Upper Arrow Key” to initiate the Pickup code.
6. The Robot switches back to automatic and drops the passenger automatically after reaching the destination. 

Thank You!
